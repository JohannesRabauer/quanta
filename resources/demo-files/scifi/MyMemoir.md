# The Gravity of Soap: Memoirs of Alaric Venn

## Prologue

My name is Alaric Venn. Born nowhere, citizen of everywhere. Or so the ship's registry declares.  
It is the year 2289, and my home is *Astraea-9*, a mid-tier generation vessel drifting in measured arcs between colonies.  
I am not a captain, nor an engineer, nor a navigator. I am a custodian of sorts—keeper of corridors, maintainer of hydroponic filters, supplier of oxygen scrubbers.  
In short, I tend to the neglected tasks that ensure others may dream of grander horizons.

This is not a story of conquest, nor of discovery. It is a meditation on soap, on bread, on the nature of walking down an endlessly lit corridor.  
I write because even in the vacuum of space, the mind refuses silence.

## On Soap and Identity

There is no "running water" aboard *Astraea-9*. Showers are timed mist cycles, a rationed spray of chemically balanced vapor. To clean oneself requires discipline.  
And yet—each morning I hold the small bar of reconstituted soap in my hand, and I am struck by its gravity. Not the ship’s simulated pull, but the *meaning* gravity.

Soap is continuity. Soap carries the faint scent of Earth. It is lavender this year, though last quarter it was citrus, and once—before shortages—it was pine.  
I remember none of these plants personally, but I remember their idea. A tree, a grove, a horizon.

Every time I wash, I wonder: am I scrubbing away my human history, or preserving it? Does the act of bathing signify rebellion against entropy, or surrender to it?  
Perhaps both.

## Bread in the Dark

Our bread is algae-based, extruded by machines, endlessly uniform.  
I chew it each evening, feeling its weight in my jaw. Each bite provokes the same thought: bread was once holy. Bread was once shared at tables, torn with hands, soaked in oils. Here it is rationed squares, vacuum-sealed, bland.

I tried once to bless it, silently, before eating. I whispered words I half-remembered from an old recording of Earth rituals. It felt foolish—and yet, I felt something stir.  
Could bread be sacred even when produced by bio-printers? If meaning comes from ritual, perhaps yes. If meaning comes from origin, perhaps not.

Still, each mouthful demands an answer.

## The Philosophy of Dust

One might think dust impossible aboard a sealed spacecraft. And yet, it exists. Sloughed skin, fibers of clothing, spores that cling to persistence.  
I sweep them daily. My broom is carbon-fiber, designed for efficiency. Yet as I sweep, I am plagued by questions.

Is dust the record of life, or the decay of it? Each particle is evidence that we endure, that we shed and persist. But too much dust and the air becomes hostile.  
So, dust is both testament and threat.

Once, I gathered the sweepings in a small jar. I looked at them under magnification. I felt like an archaeologist at the ruins of a city that never was.  
Then I emptied the jar into the recycler. Ashes to ashes. Dust to algae. The cycle persists.

## Walking the Infinite Corridor

I often walk the main corridor when I cannot sleep. It stretches the length of *Astraea-9*, a thousand meters of artificial daylight, punctuated by identical bulkheads.  
To walk it is to confront infinity—not the cosmic kind, but the banal.

Every step is the same, and yet every step is different. My left foot grows slightly more tired than the right. My breathing aligns with the hum of the engines.  
I count the doors, I lose count, I begin again.

Here, I wrestle with the absurd. If existence is merely repetition of steps, of doors, of breaths, what meaning is there? Perhaps the meaning is in the awareness itself.  
Perhaps to notice the sameness is to transcend it.

Or perhaps it is simply insomnia, dressed in philosophy.

## Epilogue: The Weight of Nothing

Out here, life is not marked by wars or empires, but by soap, bread, dust, and corridors.  
I once believed the mundane was trivial. Now I see it is the only true stage for philosophy. Great questions do not hide in stars—they linger in how one sweeps, how one chews, how one washes.

The universe expands endlessly. I live in its smallest rituals.  
And in these rituals, I am infinite.
