# The Grain of Sorrow: The Testament of Matthias Krüger

## Prologue

My name is Matthias Krüger, son of no one known beyond our hamlet of Altenwald.  
The year of Our Lord is uncertain—some say 1348, others 1349—but all agree that death walks faster than time.  
I till the soil, when it is not frozen. I bury the dead, when they fall. And I pray, though God seldom answers.

What I write, I write in the charcoal of burnt oak upon parchment scavenged from a priest’s ruin.  
I do not write for glory, but for remembrance—that someone, someday, might know that we once lived, and thought, and feared.

## On Bread and the Fear of Emptiness

Bread is no longer bread. It is mold and husk, the taste of survival turned bitter.  
Each morning I knead what little grain remains with water drawn from a stream that smells of rot.  
Still, I bake. Not for nourishment, but for hope.

When I was a child, bread was soft, warm, blessed on feast days. Now it is rationed in silence, a sacrament of endurance.  
Mother said that to eat is to praise the Lord. But when my belly groans louder than my prayers, I wonder—does hunger make us pious, or forgotten?

There is talk that bread itself carries death, that mold seeps the plague. Yet to starve is certain death.  
Thus I eat, crossing myself not in faith, but in fear.

## The Sound of Bells

The church bell tolls each morning. Not for prayer, but for the dead.  
Its echo rolls over the valley like a sigh too heavy for heaven.

Once, we counted the dead. Now we simply dig. The priest has lost his voice, his sermons now replaced by silence and gesture.  
Each time the bell rings, I feel the weight of its iron in my chest. How can metal grieve more than man?

Sometimes, when the wind carries the sound too long, I wonder if the bell tolls for me already—if time moves faster for those who expect nothing more from it.

## The Philosophy of Rats

There are rats everywhere now. They feed well, perhaps better than we.  
At first we trapped them. Then we prayed against them. Now, we simply live beside them, equals in the kingdom of hunger.

They fear no death, for they know no meaning. And perhaps that is their wisdom.  
I envy them their simplicity. To live without the burden of why—what freedom that must be.

When I see them run over the corpses we lay in trenches, I feel no anger. I feel recognition.  
They feast, we despair. Both acts sustain life in their own manner.

Perhaps God made them our mirror.

## On Light and the Absence Thereof

Candles are rarer now than gold. We burn resin and tallow that stinks of beasts long dead.  
In the dark, shadows stretch across the walls, shaped like the memories of those I’ve lost. I talk to them sometimes.

There is peace in darkness. It hides the sores, the trembling hands, the hollow cheeks.  
When dawn comes, I curse it. Light reveals too much. Light reminds me of what is gone.

Still, I cannot live without it. Even a flicker keeps despair at bay. It is strange—how a thing so frail can guard against madness.

## Epilogue: The Weight of the Living

If this world is punishment, I do not know the crime.  
We are born hungry, live in fear, and die unremembered. And yet—somewhere between the bell and the bread, the rat and the dawn—I find a kind of grace.

To rise each morning, to plant seed in a field of graves, to whisper a name into the void and wait for silence—that is faith enough.

Should these words be found by another age, let them know: we were not beasts.  
We loved, we wept, we pondered the meaning of the smallest crumb.

And though death ruled, we lived in defiance of it.
